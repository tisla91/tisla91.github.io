                <h3>About</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                I recently received a Master in Bioinformatics degree from RIT (Rochester Institute of Technology), and
                I am interested in the applications of AI in the biomedical field. Currently, I work as a Research Assistant
                in Hudson lab at RIT. Before now, I applied complex deep learning models like LLM, and GNN in 
                proteomics research at Cui Lab. In my master thesis, I researched the use of multimodal data (genomic, histopathology images, and clinical data) 
                for prediction of distant metastasis in carcinoma patients, and machine learning for identification of biomarkers
                of cancer metastasis. My knowledge, skills and experience extends through computational skills, molecular biology, 
                and clinical patient management. I have a background in clinical dentistry, and I practiced for about 4 years prior 
                to enrolling in the Bioinformatics program.
